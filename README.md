# AI Model Match

AI Model Match is an open-source service that helps product teams release, test, and optimize prompt configurations for AI-powered applications. It transforms the traditionally manual, trial-and-error process into an automated system that continuously identifies the best-performing configurations for each use case.

## üöÄ Overview

AI Model Match enables you to:

- Define **use cases** as product goals (e.g., recommending a movie or planning a trip).
- Create **flows**, representing different strategies to achieve the goal.
- Break down each flow into **steps**, precise configurations that guide AI behavior at each stage.
- Intelligently distribute traffic to ensure consistency and optimization.
- Collect feedback from users and product teams, using it to automatically improve flow performance.

In short, AI Model Match allows product managers to iterate quickly on AI solutions, reduce dependence on engineering, and continually improve the user experience.

## üìê Service Structure

1. **Use Case**  
   Represents a product goal and defines the scope of experimentation.

2. **Flow**  
   Each use case can have multiple flows, candidate configurations to achieve the goal.

3. **Step**  
   Each flow is divided into steps, specifying how the AI should behave at that stage.

4. **Sessions & Correlation ID**  
   Each interaction is tied to a unique correlation ID, ensuring all steps follow the same flow for a consistent and predictable experience.

5. **Feedback**  
   Users or teams can submit ratings and notes, which feed the system to optimize flow selection automatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Rollout Strategy

AI Model Match manages flow releases using three main phases:

1. **Warmup** ‚Äì Gradually introduce a new flow until the target traffic is reached.
2. **Adaptive** ‚Äì Automatically adjust traffic distribution based on feedback, routing more traffic to higher-performing flows until one converges to 100%.
3. **Escape** ‚Äì Automatic rollback if a flow underperforms, minimizing risks and protecting user experience.

## üí° Benefits

**For Product Managers**

- Faster iteration on AI configurations
- Reduced dependence on engineering teams
- Data-driven decision making

**For End Users**

- More reliable and consistent AI experiences
- Interactions that continuously improve based on real feedback

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

AI Model Match is an open-source microservice that can be integrated with other AI applications. Currently, it can be deployed as a standalone service, with potential future development as a SaaS offering for easier adoption.

---

## üìà How It Works

1. Define a use case (product goal).
2. Create one or more flows with specific steps.
3. Release the flows and let the system handle traffic distribution and feedback collection.
4. Watch as the system automatically optimizes the best-performing flows.
